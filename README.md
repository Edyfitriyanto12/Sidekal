## Results
### Model Performance
This section is an overview of the performance of our fine-tuned VGG16 model on a custom dataset. The primary objective was to achieve optimal classification accuracy for images across various classes. The model was trained using different hyperparameter configurations, and we assess its effectiveness through key performance metrics.
Describe all results found in your final project experiments, including hyperparameters tuning and architecture modification performances. Put it into table format. Please show pictures (of model accuracy, loss, etc.) for more clarity.

#### 1. Metrics
The table below summarizes the model's performance across different experiments

| model | epoch | learning_rate | momentum | batch_size | optimizer | train_accuracy | val_accuracy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| vgg16 | 5 | 0.001 | - | 32 | Adam | 97% | 96% | 
| vgg16 | 5 | 0.001 | 0.9 | 43 | SGD | 98% | 97% |
| vgg16 | 5 | 0.01 | 0.9 | 43 | SGD | 97% | 96% |
| vgg16 | 10 | 0.01 | - | 43 | Adagard | 96% | 98% |

#### 2. Ablation Study

### Testing
The data we use for testing is data that has been adjusted to the format in deployment. 10 data in testing gave appropriate results.

### Deployment
Our deployment leverages Streamlit, a powerful Python library for creating interactive web applications, to facilitate the seamless and user-friendly selection of lockers based on facial recognition.

if you want to try running the program with original data, you can download the model [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sO6vQMFZmZaV3uD47ovzGRN8LuQ55hGf/view?usp=sharing). But, if you want to use your own data, you have to retrain the model with your data.
